The implemented SingleConsumerQueue is a thread-safe structure that allows multiple threads to add elements simultaneously by utilizing atomic operations. 
As a result, enqueue operations do not require the use of traditional locks. 
The removal of elements (the dequeue operation) is designed with the assumption that only one thread will perform dequeue operations at a given time. 
However, the code can be adjusted by adding a locking mechanism using an atomic flag, which would allow a single thread to execute the dequeue operation at any given moment. 
The final decision depends on more specific project requirements.
